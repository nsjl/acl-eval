<h1>ACLBot Chat Transcript</h1>
<h2 class='title'>BERTScore</h2>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> Hi there, I am ACLBot, your assistant for literature research in the ACL Anthology. What would you like to know?</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> Can you find the first paper to use the BERTScore metric?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> The first paper to use the BERTScore metric is titled &quot;Counterfactual Story Reasoning and Generation.&quot; It was published in the year 2019, and its identifier in the ACL Anthology is D19-1509.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> How many papers used it in that year?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> In 2019, three papers used the BERTScore metric.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> How about in 2020?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> In 2020, 36 papers used the BERTScore metric.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> How many papers in total in 2020 used evaluation metrics of any kind?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> In 2020, a total of 5,917 papers used evaluation metrics of any kind.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> So as a percentage of that BertScore accounted for what percentage?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> In 2020, 36 papers used the BERTScore metric out of a total of 5,917 papers that used evaluation metrics. To calculate the percentage:<br><br>\[<br>\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{36}{5917}\right) \times 100 \approx 0.608\%<br>\]<br><br>BERTScore accounted for approximately 0.608% of the papers using evaluation metrics in 2020.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> What percentage of papers in that year were either using or about BERT?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> In 2020, a total of 1,225 papers were either using BERT or were about BERT. To find the percentage:<br><br>\[<br>\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{1225}{5917}\right) \times 100 \approx 20.7\%<br>\]<br><br>Approximately 20.7% of papers in 2020 were either using or about BERT.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> Hmm. So there were many papers about BERT but they didn&#x27;t use that metric. What did they use?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> In 2020, papers related to BERT primarily used a wide variety of metrics beyond BERTScore. Some of the popular metrics included:<br><br>1. **F1-score**: Used to evaluate the accuracy and relevance of models, particularly for classification tasks.<br>2. **Accuracy**: Represents the overall correctness of the model&#x27;s predictions.<br>3. **ROUGE (various types)**: Commonly used in summarization and text generation tasks to measure overlap with reference outputs.<br>4. **BLEU**: Used primarily in machine translation to measure the quality of translated text against reference translations.<br>5. **Precision and Recall**: Often used alongside F1-score to evaluate the performance across precision-recall tasks.<br>6. **Exact Match**: Measures how many predictions exactly match the reference answers in tasks like reading comprehension.<br>7. **Recall**: Reflects the ability of the model to find all relevant instances in evaluations.<br>8. **Cosine Similarity**: Used to measure linguistic or semantic similarity.<br>9. **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: Commonly used in binary classification issues to evaluate the model&#x27;s ability to differentiate classes.<br><br>These metrics provided a diverse set of evaluation tools for different aspects of model performance and quality.</div>
