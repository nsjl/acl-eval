<h2 class='title'>Model and metric usage trends</h2>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> What does the trend in BERT adoption look like?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b><div class='image'><img src='20250713_164409_11bebf.png' style='max-width:100%;'></div></div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> The trend in BERT adoption over the years, based on the number of papers that mention it, is as follows:<br><br>- In 2010 and 2015, there was minimal mention of BERT in research papers, with only 1 paper each year.<br>- It first appeared in 2018 with 1 paper, which marked the beginning of its adoption.<br>- In 2019, BERT was mentioned in 439 papers, indicating a significant increase in interest.<br>- The number of papers continued to rise in 2020 with 1225 papers and peaked in 2022 with 1485 papers.<br>- In 2023, the number dropped slightly to 1233 papers.<br>- Predictions for future years show a decline in mention, with 941 papers in 2024 and just 84 papers in 2025.<br><br>This trend shows a rapid rise in the adoption of BERT after its introduction, peaking around 2022, and then a gradual decline in its mention in subsequent years.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> How frequently has the gpt-3 model been used in recent years?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> The frequency of GPT-3 model usage in research papers over recent years is as follows:<br><br>- In 2020, shortly after GPT-3 was introduced, it was mentioned in 4 papers.<br>- Its usage increased in 2021 to 26 papers, reflecting growing interest.<br>- By 2022, the model&#x27;s presence grew significantly with 103 papers.<br>- In 2023, GPT-3 usage peaked with mentions in 234 papers.<br>- For 2024, the count moderated slightly to 151 papers.<br>- Predictions for 2025 suggest a substantial drop, with only 4 papers mentioning GPT-3.<br><br>Overall, GPT-3 has seen a sharp increase in usage since its introduction, peaking in 2023 before declining again.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> How has interest in summarization evolved over time?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> To determine how interest in summarization has evolved in research over time, we can perform a query to find out the number of papers that have worked on summarization tasks each year. Let me fetch that information for you.</div>

<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> Which years saw peaks in question answering research?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> The peaks in question answering research over the years are as follows:<br><br>- The interest in question answering has accelerated significantly from 2010 onwards.<br>- In 2018, there were 72 papers focused on question answering.<br>- The number increased to 107 papers in 2019 and continued to grow in subsequent years.<br>- By 2021, there were 205 papers, followed by an increase to 284 papers in 2022.<br>- The year 2023 saw 319 papers, indicating a growing trend.<br>- The peak is observed in 2024, with 454 papers focused on question answering.<br>- A noticeable decline is predicted for 2025, with 53 papers.<br><br>Overall, question answering research has experienced significant growth, particularly from 2018 onwards, peaking in 2024.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> How widely used is the F1 score as a metric?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> The F1-score has seen varying levels of usage over the years in research papers. Here is a summary of its trend:<br><br>- Initially, in 2013, only 1 paper used the F1-score as a metric.<br>- From 2014 to 2017, its usage remained relatively low, with 3 to 5 papers each year.<br>- In 2018, there was an uptick, with the number of papers increasing to 11.<br>- This was followed by 7 papers in 2019 and then a more noticeable rise in 2020, with 19 papers.<br>- The growth continued modestly in 2021 with 21 papers, and more prominently in 2022 with 33 papers.<br>- The upward trend strengthened in 2023, with 39 papers using the F1-score.<br>- In 2024, this metric reached its peak usage in 57 papers.<br>- Predictions for 2025 show a decrease to 9 papers.<br><br>Overall, the F1-score has gained more prominence over time, especially from 2018 onwards, peaking in 2024 before a sharp decline anticipated in 2025.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> What do average F1-score values look like over this decade?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> To determine how the F1-score has been reported and utilized in research over the past decade, we can construct a query to gather data about papers that have used the F1-score as a metric year by year. Let me perform that query for you.</div>

<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> Has BLEU usage increased year by year?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> The usage of the BLEU metric in research papers over the past years is as follows:<br><br>- From 2010 to 2013, BLEU usage increased gradually from 251 papers to 288 papers.<br>- In 2014 and 2015, there was a slight decrease, with 287 and 255 papers respectively.<br>- From 2016 onwards, BLEU usage started to rise significantly, with 308 papers in 2016, reaching 317 in 2017.<br>- The increase became more pronounced in 2018 with 478 papers, continuing sharply in 2019 with 642 papers.<br>- The upward trend continued through 2020 with 821 papers, 2021 with 854 papers, and 2022 with 953 papers.<br>- By 2023, the number had risen to 1015 papers, reaching 1046 papers in 2024.<br>- For 2025, there is a noticeable drop to 97 papers.<br><br>Overall, BLEU usage showed a steady increase from the mid-2010s, peaking in 2024, before a sharp decline in 2025.</div>
<div class='card user'><b>User:</b> What are the top metrics used in the database?</div>
<div class='card assistant'><b>Bot:</b> The top metrics used in the database, ranked by their frequency of usage in research papers, are as follows:<br><br>1. **F1-score**: This metric is the most widely used, with a total of 14,194 instances of usage across various research papers.<br>2. **Accuracy**: Following closely, accuracy is used 13,561 times, showcasing its importance for evaluating performance.<br>3. **BLEU**: The BLEU score, predominantly used in machine translation tasks, appears 8,185 times.<br>4. **Precision**: This metric is utilized 5,364 times, highlighting its role in assessing model performance alongside recall and F1-score.<br><br>These metrics are essential tools for evaluating different aspects of model performance across various tasks in the field.</div>
